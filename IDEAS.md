## 🏇 Racing Concepts

### Horse/Character Race
- Side-scrolling race with named characters
- Random speed variations, occasional stumbles
- Photo finish at the end
- Could be: horses, reindeer, elves, rockets

### Mountain Climbers
- Vertical climb up a mountain/cliff
- Random events: avalanches, power-ups, slips
- First to summit wins (or last standing)
- Weather effects for atmosphere

### Space Race
- Rockets/spaceships racing to a star/planet
- Gravity wells that slow/speed racers
- Slingshot mechanics around planets
- Asteroid obstacles
- Could incorporate orbital mechanics

### Marble Run
- Physics-based marbles rolling through course
- Splits, ramps, loops, obstacles
- Multiple paths that merge
- Last marble to finish OR first to cross line

## ⚔️ Combat/Elimination Concepts

### Battle Royale
- Names start in arena/circle
- Shrinking safe zone
- Random eliminations with effects
- Dramatic countdown for final two
- Health bars, damage numbers

### Gladiator Arena
- Turn-based or real-time combat
- Attack/defense animations
- Special moves, critical hits
- Tournament bracket OR free-for-all

### Snake.io Battle
- Auto-playing snakes with names
- Collect food to grow
- Collision = elimination
- Last snake alive wins
- Could show length/score

## 🎰 Chance/Elimination Concepts

### Slot Machine Roulette
- Spinning wheels with all names
- Gradually slow down
- Near-misses for tension
- Classic casino aesthetic

### Elimination Circles
- All names in circles/bubbles
- Randomly pop/fade/explode out
- Speed increases as fewer remain
- Last circle standing wins

### Dice Tower
- Names on falling dice
- Physics simulation
- Last die to settle wins
- OR highest number wins

### Plinko Board
- Names drop from top like Plinko chips
- Bounce through pegs
- Different slots at bottom
- Winner slot lights up

## 🎪 Misc Creative Concepts

### Survivor Island
- Names on deserted island
- Random events eliminate people (storms, etc)
- Tribal council vibe
- Torches snuff out

### Russian Roulette (safe version)
- Names in chairs around table
- Harmless "elimination" (confetti, water spray)
- Tension builds with each round
- Last person wins

### Musical Chairs
- Animated characters walking around chairs

## 🎨 Visual Styles to Consider

- **Retro pixel art** (8-bit Christmas)
- **Smooth modern vectors** (clean, professional)
- **Hand-drawn sketchy** (casual, fun)
- **3D-ish** (isometric or pseudo-3D)
- **Particle effects heavy** (dramatic, flashy)
- **Minimalist geometric** (abstract, elegant)

---

## 🎄 Christmas/Winter Theming

Many concepts can be themed:
- ❄️ Snowflake falling race
- 🎅 Santa's sleigh race
- 🎁 Gift unwrapping race
- ⛷️ Ski/sled downhill
- 🕯️ Advent candles (one goes out each round)
- 🔔 Bell ringing competition

## Technical Considerations

### Libraries/Tools
- **p5.js** - Great for creative coding, easy animations
- **Canvas API** - Vanilla JS, full control
- **Phaser** - Game engine, physics built-in
- **Three.js** - 3D effects if we want to go fancy
- **Matter.js** - 2D physics (for marble run, dice)
- **GSAP** - Animation library for smooth tweens
- **Processing** - If we want desktop app instead

### Features to Include
- Sound effects (optional, can mute)
- Background music
- Pause/restart capability
- Speed controls (for testing)
- Winner announcement with fanfare
- Export/save results
- Replay with same seed (reproducible)

## Next Steps

1. Pick 1-2 favorites to prototype
2. Build skill that can implement any of these
3. Iterate and add more over time
